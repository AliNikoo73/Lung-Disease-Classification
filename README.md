# 🩺 **Lung Disease Classification Using Fine-Tuned Pre-Trained Models on X-ray Images**

---

## 📜 **Summary**

This project leverages the power of **deep learning** to classify **lung diseases** using X-ray images. The dataset consists of five classes:

- **Bacterial Pneumonia**
- **Coronavirus Disease**
- **Tuberculosis**
- **Viral Pneumonia**
- **Normal**

We use **pre-trained models** from the Keras library, such as **VGG16, ResNet152V2, and DenseNet201**, which are fine-tuned for optimal performance. The models undergo multiple trials, where **data augmentation** and preprocessing techniques are applied to improve generalization.

Key performance metrics such as **accuracy**, **loss**, and **confusion matrices** are generated, along with **Grad-CAM** heatmaps to interpret and visualize the model’s decisions.

💡 **Significance:** Early and accurate detection of lung diseases can greatly improve patient outcomes, especially in **resource-limited** settings where such technology can augment healthcare delivery.

## 🎯 **Objective**
> To accurately classify lung diseases using fine-tuned pre-trained models and interpret model decisions using visual explainability techniques like Grad-CAM.
