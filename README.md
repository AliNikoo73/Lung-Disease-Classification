Title:
Designing and Fine-Tuning Deep Learning Models for Lung X-Ray Image Classification

Summary:
This project focuses on leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to develop an accurate and reliable model for classifying lung X-ray images. By utilizing multiple pre-trained models from the Keras Applications library (e.g., VGG16, ResNet152V2, InceptionV3), the project aims to compare their performance and fine-tune them to maximize accuracy. The process includes training, evaluating, and testing various models using a structured approach to identify the optimal architecture for lung X-ray image classification. The project integrates model fine-tuning for each base model, leveraging modern techniques in transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning. This approach not only enhances model performance but also provides insights into the most effective model for this medical imaging task. The ultimate goal is to aid in the early detection of lung conditions, potentially improving patient outcomes.
